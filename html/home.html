              <br>
              <p>
                Most natural action tends to follow an arched trajectory, and animation should <br>
                adhere to this principle by following implied "arcs" for greater realism. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                As an object's speed or momentum increases, arcs tend to flatten out in moving <br>
                ahead and broaden in turns. An object in motion that moves out of its natural arc<br>
                will appear erratic rather than fluid.
