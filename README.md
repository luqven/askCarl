Hi! This is the README for **askCarl**. askCarl is a Javascript app that displays complex Javascrpipt & CSS concepts as simple animations. The goal is to display how the two languages can be used to achieve some of the most tried and true animation techniques on one's webpage.

Although traditionally animation techniques were meant for film animators, these tested strategies translate well to uesr's expectations of webpage componenet behavior. Scroll bouncing, gesture navigation, scroll-to-zoom being some prime examples.

The list of askCarl's animation is heavily inspired by the video **The Illusion of Life** [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/93206523)

# Architecture 

askCarl is a single-page app that loads a CSS animation as the users scrolls. After each animation loads, dsiplays, and ends, it atuomatically restarts after a small period of time. Some of the animations can be intearcted with by the user. 

The user can browse askCarl by simply scrolling up or down the page, or, when applicable, cliking and scrolling inside the animation canvas.
